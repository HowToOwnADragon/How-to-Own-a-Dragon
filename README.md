# Versions:
* All the x.x.1, x.x.2, x.x.3 etc. files are Alpha files. Those files have things that are just getting added. Nothing in the alpha files is survival ready and should be downloaded to play. The Alpha files are only online so that people can download them for their own mods or for the curious people that want to know what gets added in the new stable files.
<br>

* All the x.1.0, x.2.0, x.3.0 etc. files are Beta files. Those files have finished things, but not completely tested things. That means that the beta files have things that are completely finished and technically survival ready but it hasn't completely been tested yet. The Beta files can be downloaded for survival purposes but it is not recommended. You can download the Beta files to help us test the mod to see if there is anything broken or missing in the game.
<br>

* All the 1.0.0, 2.0.0, 3.0.0 etc. files are the Official Stable Releases of the mod. The Stable releases are safe to download and use in whatever world you want. These releases are done and can be played, if you happen to find a bug or a problem with these files, please tell us so that we can update that in the future.
